Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?
Answer: A new directory called .git generated in the repository directory, the 
reason to initialize a repository, is I need to let the git do some job to 
track on this directory.


Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repostory? What value do you thing it offers?
Answer: Like repository, staging area is a abstract concept, at least not 
realistic like the working directory, it's a pre-commit area, and can split 
the changes in working directory into some little unit, instead of a whole 
large change unit.
		The staging area, give me a chance to commit those I forgot to do after 
a logic change have made, so I can commit that logic while the next feature is 
in progress.
