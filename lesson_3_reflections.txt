Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
Answer: When I need to access the repository in different locations, or I want
 to share my project to someone else not nearby.


Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
 Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: Because of the changes in remote repository may contain conflict to my
 local repository, then I need to resolve it, if the Git automatically pull 
 from remote, it may break my current job. So pull changes manually give me 
 the control of "When to resolve those conflict.".

one, and clone operate on one repository -- both local or remote, and create 
one local copy of it, fork operate on a GitHub repository, and create one copy
 on the GitHub.
 		If I want got a GitHub repository clone, and store the result on the 
 GitHub, I can use fork instead of clone, save some time, and indicate my 
 repository is a copy of the former one.
